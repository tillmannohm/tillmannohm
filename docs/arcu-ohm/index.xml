      <description>Human-Machine Collaboration Since 2018 ARCU&amp;amp;OHM is a human-machine collaboration exploring algorithmic curation since 2016. The expert system and »Artificial Curator« ARCU refers to a series of computational projects dealing with the research, selection, and contextualization of artefacts such as artworks, objects, and literature.
ARCU is continuously developed by artist and researcher Tillmann Ohm as an autonomous research system and algorithmic collaborator for machine-aided exhibition-making, publishing and prototyping curatorial tools for digital collections.</description>

      <description>Computer-generated publication Hardcover, 88 pages 2018 Download publication as PDF
The Artist’s Machine is a computational research project with the outcome of a publication, generated by an algorithm called ARCU. From researching topic-relevant literature, detecting semantic structures in hundreds of papers and books, to finally generating a publication with illustrations and paraphrased text citations, every step in the process has been performed automatically – initiated by a simple research phrase that was given as input.</description>

      <description>Algorithmic research project Since 2016 (work in progress) ARCU (Artificial Curator) is an automated system researching in the thematic field of artificial intelligence in contemporary and future art. ARCU shares relevant news, projects and articles with the world on a daily basis on Twitter (active) and on the online blog &amp;ldquo;The Artist’s Machine&amp;rdquo; (discontinued). Every blog post and tweet by ARCU is generated algorithmically.
ARCU maintaines and slowly expands it’s own network of artists and researchers on Twitter to gather and share relevant information about recent articles, artworks, research projects and events.</description>
