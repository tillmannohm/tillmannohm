      <description>The Collection Space Navigator (CSN) is an explorative visualization tool for researching collections and their multidimensional representations. We designed this tool to better understand multidimensional data, its methods, and semantic qualities through spatial navigation and filtering. CSN can be used with any image collection and can be customized for specific research needs (see Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).

      <description>The Projection Scans are interactive in-browser visualizations of different dimensionality reduction techniques, showing 2D, 3D and 6D projections of high-dimensional data. A single, linear dimension or metric provides the possibility to ‚Äúslice‚Äù through the space. This experimental tool tries to better understand the involved methods and to gain intuition of high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <guid>https://tillmannohm.com/applications/nn-comparison/</guid>
      <description>The Nearest Neighbors Comparisons are in-browser visualizations to better understand the concept of &amp;ldquo;similarity&amp;rdquo; when pre-trained deep learning models such as ResNet50 and VGG19 are used for feature extraction in image analysis. These models are commonly used to measure similarity between images, although their underlying representations are not always easy to interpret. The tool aims to offer means to evaluate the aesthetic similarity between images by comparing different methods and modelsnext to each other.</description>

      <description>Human-Machine Collaboration Since 2018 ARCU&amp;amp;OHM is a human-machine collaboration exploring algorithmic curation since 2016. The expert system and ¬ªArtificial Curator¬´ ARCU refers to a series of computational projects dealing with the research, selection, and contextualization of artefacts such as artworks, objects, and literature.
ARCU is continuously developed by artist and researcher Tillmann Ohm as an autonomous research system and algorithmic collaborator for machine-aided exhibition-making, publishing and prototyping curatorial tools for digital collections.</description>

The Artist‚Äôs Machine is a computational research project with the outcome of a publication, generated by an algorithm called ARCU. From researching topic-relevant literature, detecting semantic structures in hundreds of papers and books, to finally generating a publication with illustrations and paraphrased text citations, every step in the process has been performed automatically ‚Äì initiated by a simple research phrase that was given as input.</description>

      <description>Algorithmic research project Since 2016 (work in progress) ARCU (Artificial Curator) is an automated system researching in the thematic field of artificial intelligence in contemporary and future art. ARCU shares relevant news, projects and articles with the world on a daily basis on Twitter (active) and on the online blog &amp;ldquo;The Artist‚Äôs Machine&amp;rdquo; (discontinued). Every blog post and tweet by ARCU is generated algorithmically.
ARCU maintaines and slowly expands it‚Äôs own network of artists and researchers on Twitter to gather and share relevant information about recent articles, artworks, research projects and events.</description>

      <description>2 channel video installation 6:20 min 2016 A conversation about emotions between the two most iconic operating systems in film history: HAL from ‚Äú2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äù (1968) and Samantha from ‚ÄúHer‚Äù (2013).
Stanley Kubrick and Spike Jonze pictured their artificial main characters as voice recognition and speech synthesis operating systems. Unlike the robots in other science fiction movies, HAL and Samantha are conceptualized without the need of a physical body.</description>

      <description>Digital Superimpositions Artistic research on portrait paintings 2012/13 This study on Old Masters is an aesthetic research on portrait paintings by famous artists such as Rembrandt, Rubens and Caravaggio.
For decades, art historians have been discussing whether or not the Old Masters have immortalized themselves in the facial features of their portrayed subjects. To investigate the theory, all known and available paintings containing portraits were merged together. Only self-portraits were excluded from the stack.</description>

      <description>Interactive Object 8-bit music device 2015 The ‚ÄúElectronic Music Box‚Äù is a wooden hand cranked 8-bit music box, composed of an Arduino, a rotary encoder, 2048 pin headers, 64 LEDs, 8 shift registers, a single 8-ohm speaker, and some electronic parts such as resistors, diodes and switches.
A melody can be physically programmed with simple computing jumpers using a 16√ó128 pin grid. Every row is dedicated to a freely programmable tone while the columns are holding places for a maximum of 64 notes and pauses.</description>

      <description>[ENTER LIVE WORK] For the exhibition KUNST(RE_PUBLIC) of HALLE 14 in cooperation with the Art Fund (Kunstfonds) of the Dresden State Art Collections, a curatorial classification as well as algorithmic selection of over 370 works of art from the subsidized purchases of the Cultural Foundation of the Free State of Saxony in the collection was created. The Free State of Saxony promotes the Saxon art scene, among other things, through the annual purchases of works of art, which have taken place since 1992.</description>

      <description>Digital Superimpositions 2012 The series of stereotypes consists of various digital superimpositions. Every digital work is the result of 20 to 40 pictures algorithmically merged into a single image.
Similar to Sir Francis Galton‚Äôs and technique of Composite Portraiture1 from the 1880s, the digital fusion of images is an experimental approach to examine stereotypical features of the selected input. By repeating similarities of each picture in stack, individual details are getting lost when merged together.</description>

      <description>Digital Superimposition Video loop, 2:30 min 2013 First distributed on leaflets in 1780, the lyrics of the German revolution song ‚ÄúDie Gedanken sind frei‚Äù (‚ÄúThoughts are free‚Äù) are known as a protest for academic freedom and freedom of speech. To this day the song is in the repertoire of student corps and has been used repeatedly over decades to appeal against political oppression.
In this audiovisual projection, a choir performs the protest song in a constant repetition.</description>

      <description>Interactive Object Camera prototype 2015 The ‚ÄúInstant QR Camera‚Äù is the first working prototype made out of Polaroid camera, thermal printer, Arduino and smartphone parts. The modified instant camera immediately uploads the captured image and prints the corresponding link as binary code. A smartphone or similar device can decrypt this QR code and download the digital photograph from the cloud.
Submitting to the modern photography culture, the ‚ÄúInstant QR Camera‚Äù denies the physical existence of an image, generating the highest level of abstraction that links not only to its digital but also its virtual origin.</description>

      <description>Short film 8:30 min 2016/17 What happens when you outsource every single step of a short film production to an online marketplace? What kind of creative piece will be generated out of this labor power if you just give it a budget to work from?
The so called micro-job platforms are mainly offering services online like graphic design works or programming jobs for dumping prices. But you can also order video greetings or ask for creative writing.</description>
